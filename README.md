# oauth-webview-dotnet
This is a new library for allowing .NET Windows desktop apps to authenticate with Genesys Cloud using the new Microsoft Edge-based WebView2 control to display the login page. It is similar in principle to the existing purecloud_api_dotnet_oauth_control, which uses the old Internet Explorer-based control.
